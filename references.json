    "abstract": "  The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks in an encoder-decoder configuration. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data. ",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Signaling pathways are a cornerstone of systems biology. Several databases store high-quality representations of these pathways that are amenable for automated analyses. Despite painstaking and manual curation, these databases remain incomplete. We present P<jats:sc>ATH</jats:sc>L<jats:sc>INKER</jats:sc>, a new computational method to reconstruct the interactions in a signaling pathway of interest. P<jats:sc>ATH</jats:sc>L<jats:sc>INKER</jats:sc> efficiently computes multiple short paths from the receptors to transcriptional regulators (TRs) in a pathway within a background protein interaction network. We use P<jats:sc>ATH</jats:sc>L<jats:sc>INKER</jats:sc> to accurately reconstruct a comprehensive set of signaling pathways from the NetPath and KEGG databases. We show that P<jats:sc>ATH</jats:sc>L<jats:sc>INKER</jats:sc> has higher precision and recall than several state-of-the-art algorithms, while also ensuring that the resulting network connects receptor proteins to TRs. P<jats:sc>ATH</jats:sc>L<jats:sc>INKER</jats:sc>’s reconstruction of the Wnt pathway identified CFTR, an ABC class chloride ion channel transporter, as a novel intermediary that facilitates the signaling of Ryk to Dab2, which are known components of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. In HEK293 cells, we show that the Ryk–CFTR–Dab2 path is a novel amplifier of β-catenin signaling specifically in response to Wnt 1, 2, 3, and 3a of the 11 Wnts tested. P<jats:sc>ATH</jats:sc>L<jats:sc>INKER</jats:sc> captures the structure of signaling pathways as represented in pathway databases better than existing methods. P<jats:sc>ATH</jats:sc>L<jats:sc>INKER</jats:sc>’s success in reconstructing pathways from NetPath and KEGG databases point to its applicability for complementing manual curation of these databases. P<jats:sc>ATH</jats:sc>L<jats:sc>INKER</jats:sc> may serve as a promising approach for prioritizing proteins and interactions for experimental study, as illustrated by its discovery of a novel pathway in Wnt/β-catenin signaling.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Deep learning describes a class of machine learning algorithms that are capable of combining raw inputs into layers of intermediate features. These algorithms have recently shown impressive results across a variety of domains. Biology and medicine are data-rich disciplines, but the data are complex and often ill-understood. Hence, deep learning techniques may be particularly well suited to solve problems of these fields. We examine applications of deep learning to a variety of biomedical problems—patient classification, fundamental biological processes and treatment of patients—and discuss whether deep learning will be able to transform these tasks or if the biomedical sphere poses unique challenges. Following from an extensive literature review, we find that deep learning has yet to revolutionize biomedicine or definitively resolve any of the most pressing challenges in the field, but promising advances have been made on the prior state of the art. Even though improvements over previous baselines have been modest in general, the recent progress indicates that deep learning methods will provide valuable means for speeding up or aiding human investigation. Though progress has been made linking a specific neural network's prediction to input features, understanding how users should interpret these models to make testable hypotheses about the system under study remains an open challenge. Furthermore, the limited amount of labelled data for training presents problems in some domains, as do legal and privacy constraints on work with sensitive health records. Nonetheless, we foresee deep learning enabling changes at both bench and bedside with the potential to transform several areas of biology and medicine.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "We present a method for automatically discovering signaling pathways from time-resolved phosphoproteomic data. The Temporal Pathway Synthesizer (TPS) algorithm uses constraint-solving techniques first developed in the context of formal verification to explore paths in an interaction network. It systematically eliminates all candidate structures for a signaling pathway where a protein is activated or inactivated before its upstream regulators. The algorithm can model more than one hundred thousand dynamic phosphosites and can discover pathway members that are not differentially phosphorylated. By analyzing temporal data, TPS defines signaling cascades without needing to experimentally perturb individual proteins. It recovers known pathways and proposes pathway connections when applied to the human epidermal growth factor and yeast osmotic stress responses. Independent kinase mutant studies validate predicted substrates in the TPS osmotic stress pathway.",
